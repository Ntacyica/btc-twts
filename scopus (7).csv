New bitcoins are created at a predictable and decreasing rate, which means that the demand must follow this level of inflation to keep the price stable. Actually, the price is highly volatile, because it is affected by many factors including the supply of bitcoin, its market demand, the cost of the mining process, as well as economic and political world-class news. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach for bitcoin trend prediction, based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). First, we propose a methodology for building useful datasets that take into account social media data, the full blockchain transaction history, and a number of financial indicators. Moreover, we present a cloud-based system characterized by a highly efficient distributed architecture, which allowed us to collect a huge amount of data in order to build thousands of different datasets, using the aforementioned methodology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 1D CNN for bitcoin trend prediction. Remarkably, an efficient and low-cost implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNN models that perform one-dimensional convolutions (i.e., scalar multiplications and additions). We show that the 1D CNN model we implemented, trained, validated and tested using the aforementioned datasets, allow one to predict the bitcoin trend with higher accuracy compared to LSTM models. Last but not least, we introduce and simulate a trading strategy based on the proposed 1D CNN model, which increases the profit when the bitcoin trend is bullish and reduces the loss when the trend is bearish. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Blockchain; CNN; Financial indicators; Sentiment analysis",,"Li, X., Jiang, P., Chen, T., Luo, X., Wen, Q., A survey on the security of blockchain systems (2020) Future Gener.

To do this, we consider a vector error correction model over two overlapping periods: 2010–17 and 2010–19. Price discovery is achieved through the Gonzalo–Granger permanent-transitory decomposition. The pricing factors are endogenous linear combinations of the S&P 500 index, gold price, a Google search variable associated to Bitcoin and a fear index proxied by the FED Financial Stress Index. Our empirical analysis shows that during the first period, a linear combination of four pricing factors describes the efficient Bitcoin price. The S&P 500 index and Google searches have a positive effect whereas gold prices and the fear index have a negative effect. In contrast, during the second period, the efficient price behaves idiosyncratically and can be only rationalised by individuals' search for information on the cryptocurrency. These findings provide empirical evidence on the presence of a correction in Bitcoin prices during the period 2018–19 uncorrelated to market fundamentals. We also show that standard empirical asset pricing models perform poorly for explaining Bitcoin prices. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Bitcoin price; cointegration; cryptocurrency; factor models; permanent-transitory decomposition",,"Askitas, N., Zimmermann, K.F., Google econometrics and unemployment forecasting (2009) Applied Economics, 55 (2), pp. 107-120. , https://doi.org/10.3790/aeq.55.2.107; Bação, P., Duarte, A.P., Sebastião, H., Redzepagic, S., (2018) Information transmission between cryptocurrencies: Does bitcoin rule the cryptocurrency world?, , https://ideas.repec.org/p/gmf/papers/2018-06.html, Working Paper of Centre for Business and Economics Research; Blau, B., Price dynamics and speculative trading in bitcoin (2017) Research in International Business and Finance, 41, pp. 493-499. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ribaf.2017.05.010; Bouoiyour, J., Selmi, R., What does bitcoin look like?

We find that the total sentiment spillover among crude oil, gold and Bitcoin markets is time-varying and is greatly affected by major market events. The directional sentiment spillovers are also time-varying. On average, the Bitcoin market is the major transmitter of directional sentiment spillovers, whereas the crude oil and gold markets are the major receivers. In particular, the sentiment spillover effects are major created at high-frequency components, implying that the markets rapidly process the sentiment spillover effects and the shock is transmitted over the short-term. Moreover, we also find that the sentiment spillover effects differ significantly in term of intensity and direction when compared with return and volatility spillover effects. The present study has certain applications for investors and policymakers. © 2020 Su, Li.

On the surface, cryptocurrencies share important features in common with high sentiment beta stocks. This paper investigates the degree to which, during the period July 18, 2010–February 26, 2018, the return to bitcoin displayed the characteristics of a high sentiment beta stock. Using a sentiment-dependent factor model, the analysis indicates that in large measure, bitcoin returns resembled returns to high sentiment beta stocks. Additionally, we show that bitcoin's expected returns are low when sentiment measured by Volatility Index is high while expected returns are high when sentiment is low. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","behavioral finance; bitcoin; bubble; cryptocurrency",,"(2018), (AAII) index.

The recently proposed Lp-norm F-transform is a powerful and flexible methodology for data analysis, non-parametric smoothing and for fitting and forecasting. Its capabilities are illustrated by empirical analyses concerning Bitcoin prices and Google Trend scores (six years of daily data): we apply the (inverse) F-transform to both time series and, using clustering techniques, we identify stylized facts for Bitcoin prices, based on (local) smoothing and fitting F-transform, and we study their time evolution in terms of a transition matrix. Finally, we examine the dependence of Bitcoin prices on Google Trend scores and we estimate short-term forecasting models; the Diebold–Mariano (DM) test statistics, applied for their significance, shows that sentiment analysis is useful in short-term forecasting of Bitcoin cryptocurrency. © 2020 by the authors.

The quality of a project affects the trust in the platform, and therefore the value of the digital tokens exchanged over it. In this paper, we investigate whether developers’ emotions can effectively provide insights that can improve the prediction of the price of tokens. We consider developers’ comments and activity for two major blockchain projects, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, extracted from Github. We measure sentiment and emotions (joy, love, anger, etc.) of the developers’ comments over time, and test the corresponding time series (i.e. the affect time series) for correlations and causality with the Bitcoin/Ethereum time series of prices. Our analysis shows the existence of a Granger-causality between the time series of developers’ emotions and Bitcoin/Ethereum price. Moreover, using an artificial recurrent neural network (LSTM), we can show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)—associated with the prediction of the prices of cryptocurrencies—significantly decreases when including the affect time series. © 2020, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Data mining; Open source software development",,"Phillips, R.C., Gorse, D., Cryptocurrency price drivers: wavelet coherence analysis revisited (2018) PLoS ONE, 13 (4); Ciaian, P., Rajcaniova, M., Kancs, D.A., The economics of Bitcoin price formation (2016) Appl Econ, 48 (19), pp. 1799-1815; Cong, L.W., Ye, L., Neng, W., (2018) Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation, , .

This has led to a renewal of interest in digital currencies. Cryptocurrency one of the most prominent digital currency has found itself in spotlight with investors wanting a piece of it and business establishments accepting it as a source of payment due to its stable performance in the last few years. This research has been done on predicting cryptocurrency prices using machine learning based neural network which has a lowest the model loss over 100 epochs during training and Technical Trade Indicators (TTI) graphs depicts a real BTC value 5 to 10 times in 300-days of current fiscal year has further supported this increasing trader confidence and a shift in global cryptocurrency graph by predicted BTC values. On the same lines, we are analyzing bitcoin prices using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis. We also study stock market trends in order to better predict bitcoin prices quantitively. In this work we analyze the impact of global currencies like US Dollar, foreign exchanges on Bitcoin prices and whether Bitcoin has the stability to dethrone global currencies and become the single medium of transaction. This work is adequate enough to aid in predicting price and with results obtained from predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning based neural network achieving an accuracy of 94.89% under all circumstances of technical trade indication thereby bringing down its price prediction by over 13.7% in April 2020 itself during evaluation. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; economics; machine learning; neural network; prediction; technical trade",,"Calès, L., Chalkis, A., Emiris, I.Z., Fisikopoulos, V., Practical volume computation of structured convex bodies, and an application to modeling portfolio dependencies and financial crises (2018) Proc.

This study proposes a two-stage decomposition and composition method (2SDC) that begins with a Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (NA-MEMD) for better interpreting cryptocurrency formations. This study involves daily closing price data from six cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Monero and Dash) from July 23rd, 2017 to July 23rd, 2019. In the first stage, six time series are jointly decomposed into 10 independent intrinsic mode functions (IMF) from high to low frequency plus one residual. In the second stage, the IMFs for each cryptocurrency are composed into three components based on Wilcoxon signed-rank test, including high and low frequency components and a long-term trend. These three multi-scale components can be interpreted as short-term fluctuations caused by investor sentiment and micro-structure, the effect of significant events and fundamental values. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the low and high frequency compositions are determining factors of cryptocurrency prices, which supports for the existing evidence (e.g. Bouoiyour, Selmi, Tiwari, & Olayeni, 2016; Ji, Bouri, Lau, & Roubaud, 2019). © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition; Two-stage decomposition and composition","72073126, 71703156, 71988101","Aslanidis, N., Bariviera, A.F., Martínez-Ibañez, O., An analysis of cryptocurrencies conditional cross correlations (2019) Finance Research Letters, 31, pp. 130-137; Balcilar, M., Bouri, E., Gupta, R., Roubaud, D., Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility?

Nevertheless, the users of machine learning usually find that these sophisticated techniques could incur a high level of tensions caused by the selection of the appropriate size of the training data set among other factors. In this paper, we provide a systematic way of resolving such tensions by examining practical examples of predicting popularity and sentiment of posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs on Mashable, news on Google and Yahoo, the US house survey, and Bitcoin prices. Interesting results show that for the case of big data, using around 20% of the full sample often leads to a better prediction accuracy than opting for the full sample. Our conclusion is found to be consistent across a series of experiments. The managerial implication is that using more is not necessarily the best and users need to be cautious about such an important sensitivity as the simplistic approach may easily lead to inferior solutions with potentially detrimental consequences. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Data size; Machine learning; Prediction accuracy; Social media",,"Abdollahi, M., Khaleghi, T., Yang, K., An integrated feature learning approach using deep learning for travel time prediction (2020) Expert Syst.

Asset pricing is a risky and challenging activity that enchants lots of shareholders. Indeed, the difficulty in making predictions lies in understanding the multiple factors that affect the Bitcoin price trend. Modeling the market behavior and thus, the sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem provides an insight into the predictions of the Bitcoin price. While there are significant studies that investigate the token economics based on the Bitcoin network, limited research has been performed to analyze the network sentiment on the overall Bitcoin price. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of network sentiments and explore statistical and deep-learning methods to predict Bitcoin future price. In particular, we analyze financial and sentiment features extracted from economic and crowd-sourced data respectively, and we show how the sentiment is the most significant factor in predicting Bitcoin market stocks. Next, we compare two models used for Bitcoin time-series predictions: the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). We demonstrate that both models achieve optimal results on new predictions, with a mean squared error lower than 0.14%, due to the inclusion of the studied sentiment feature. Besides, since the ARIMAX achieves better predictions than the RNN, we also prove that, with just a linear model, we may obtain outstanding market forecasts in the Bitcoin scenario. © 2020 IEEE.","Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous input (ARIMAX); Bitcoin (BTC); Market Stock Prediction; Recurrent Neural Network (RNN); Sentiment Analysis","2019YFB1405000","Rajput, V., Bobde, S., Stock market prediction using hybrid approach (2016) International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA), pp. 82-86; Shah, D., Isah, H., Zulkernine, F., Stock market analysis: A review and taxonomy of prediction techiques (2019) International Journal of Financial Studies, 7 (26), pp. 1-22; Fu, K., Rosenfeld, A., Pattern recognition and image processing (1976) Ieee Transactions on Computers, 25, pp. 1336-1346; Zhou, B., Hu, J., A dynamic pattern recognition approach based on neural network for stock time-series (2009) World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC), pp. 1552-1555; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2, pp. 1-8; Goldberg, D., Nichols, D.A., Oki, B.M., Terry, D.B., Using collaborative filtering to weave an information tapestry (1992) Communications of the Acm, 35, pp. 61-70; Pagolu, V.S., Reddy, K.N., Panda, G., Majhi, B., Sentiment analysis of twitter data for predicting stock market movements (2016) International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Power and Embedded System (SCOPES), pp. 1345-1350; Jethin, A., Higdon, D., Nelson, J., Ibarra, J., Cryptocurrency price prediction using tweet volumes and sentiment analysis (2018) Smu Data Science Review, 1 (3); Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G., (1990) Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control, , Holden-Day, Inc.

Bitcoin has experienced significant price swings in daily and long-term valuations. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) model on the bitcoin transaction network for forecasting the bitcoin price movement. Through analysis of bitcoin subgraphs or chainlets, the PDE model captures the influence of transaction patterns on the bitcoin price over time and combines the effect of all chainlet clusters. In addition, Google Trends index is incorporated to the PDE model to reflect the effect of the bitcoin market sentiment. The experiment results demonstrate that the PDE model is capable of forecasting the bitcoin price movement. The paper is the first attempt to apply a PDE model to the bitcoin transaction network for forecasting. © 2020 Author(s).",,"19CGL002

Like sentiment analysis, Bitcoin which is a digital cryptocurrency also attracts the researchers considerably in the domain of cryptography, computer science, and economics. The objective of this work is to forecast the direction of Bitcoin price by analyzing user opinions in social media such as Twitter. To our knowledge, this is the very first attempt which estimates the direction of Bitcoin price fluctuations by using word embedding models in addition to deep learning techniques in the state-of-the-art studies. For the purpose of estimating the direction of Bitcoin, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long-short term memory networks (LSTMs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used as deep learning architectures and Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText are employed as word embedding models in the experiments. In order to demonstrate the contribution of our work, experiments are carried out on English Twitter dataset. Experiment results show that the usage of FastText model as a word embedding model outperforms other models with 89.13% accuracy value to estimate the direction of Bitcoin price. © 2020, Ismail Saritas.

Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","cryptocurrencies; machine learning; sentiment analysis; social media; speculative models",,"Abraham, J., Higdon, D., Nelson, J., Ibarra, J., Cryptocurrency price prediction using tweet volumes and sentiment analysis (2018) SMU Data Science Review, 1 (3), p. 1; Alessandretti, L., ElBahrawy, A., Aiello, L.M., Baronchelli, A., (2018) Machine learning the cryptocurrency market, , SSRN 3183792; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X.-J., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2, pp. 1-8. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Bottou, L., Large-scale machine learning with stochastic gradient descent (2010) Proceedings of COMPSTAT'2010, pp. 177-186. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-7908-2604-3_16, Y.

Identification of such relations is crucial because their existence may be used to create a broad spectrum of analyses and reports about cryptocurrency projects and to obtain a comprehensive outlook of the blockchain domain. The activities on the blockchain reach different levels of anonymity which renders them hard objects of studies. In particular, the standard tools used to characterize social trends and variables that describe cryptocurrencies' situations are unsuitable to be used in the environment that extensively employs cryptographic techniques to hide real users. The employment ofWikipedia to trace crypto assets value need examination because the portal allows gathering of different opinions-content of the articles is edited by a group of people. Consequently, the information can be more attractive and useful for the readers than in case of non-collaborative sources of information. Wikipedia Articles often appears in the premium position of such search engines as Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. One may expect different demand on information about particular cryptocurrency depending on the different events (e.g., sharp fluctuations of price). Wikipedia offers only information about cryptocurrencies that are important from the point of view of language community of the users inWikipedia. This ""filter"" helps to better identify those cryptocurrencies that have a significant influence on the regional markets. The models encompass linkages between different variables and properties. In one model cryptocurrency projects are ranked with the means of articles sentiment and quality. In another model, Wikipedia visits are linked to cryptocurrencies' popularity. Additionally, the interactions between information demand in different Wikipedia language versions are elaborated. They are used to assess the geographical esteem of certain crypto coins. The information about the legal status of cryptocurrency technologies in different states that are offered by Wikipedia is used in another proposed model. It allows assessment of the adoption of cryptocurrencies in a given legislature. Finally, a model is developed that joins Wikipedia articles editions and deletions with the social sentiment towards particular cryptocurrency projects. The mentioned analytical purposes that permit assessment of the popularity of blockchain technologies in different local communities are not the only results of the paper. The models can show which country has the biggest demand on particular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin and others. © 2020 by the authors.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Information demand; Information quality; Wikipedia",,"Cuomo, M.T., Tortora, D., Giordano, A., Festa, G., Metallo, G., Martinelli, E., User-generated content in the era of digital well-being: A netnographic analysis in a healthcare marketing context (2020) Psychol.

In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1–14% of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter “bot” accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bots; Cryptocurrencies; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis; Twitter",,"Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is All That Talk Just Noise?

Although significant attention has been devoted to their pricing properties, to-date, academic literature on behavioral drivers remains less developed. We explore the question of how price dynamics of cryptocurrencies are influenced by the interaction between behavioral factors behind investor decisions and publicly accessible data flows. We use sentiment analysis to model the effects of public sentiment toward investment markets in general, and cryptocurrencies in particular on crypto assets’ valuations. Our results show that investor sentiment can predict the price direction of cryptocurrencies, indicating direct impact of herding and anchoring biases. We also discuss a new direction for analyzing behavioral drivers of the crypto assets based on the use of natural language AI to extract better quality data on investor sentiment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Behavioral finance; Bitcoin; Blockchain; Crypto assets; Cryptocurrencies; Ethereum; Investment markets; Ripple",,"Alabi, K., Digital blockchain networks appear to be following Metcalfe's law (2017) Electron.

Much less work has been carried out into examining whether a technology adoption has impact on corporate reputation. This paper aims to examine the latter topic in a context where social media is the channel used to share news about the introduction of a new technology. The empirical setting of the study consists of five retail companies located in the USA that decided to include Bitcoin as a payment platform. Design/methodology/approach: Twitter data were used to measure how sharing news about the adoption of new technology could affect the reputation of the companies selected, keeping a clear distinction between the volume of data relating to social media responses and the sentiment expressed in the tweets. A panel vector autoregression model was used to incorporate series of data relating to news items, volume and sentiment. Findings: The results show that the news about the adoption of a new technology has a positive impact on both the volume of tech-related tweets and the sentiment expressed in the tweets themselves, although the patterns of these two effects are different. The resulting impact decreases after a few days, both in volume and in sentiment. Research limitations/implications: The analysis has limitations that future research could address by extending and diversifying the examined companies and the social media used as data sources. The research suggests that managers in medium-sized companies can leverage on the introduction of new technologies that have a direct impact on their customers and gain reputational benefits in terms of immediate visibility. Originality/value: The research introduces an additional dimension of analysis to the current stream of corporate reputation. Although the literature has already covered the dynamics of response to events on Twitter, by focusing on the adoption of the new Bitcoin technology, the paper provides novel insights. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Corporate reputation; Sentiment analysis; Social media analysis; Technology adoption; Vector autoregression",,"Agarwal, J., Stackhouse, M., Osiyevskyy, O., I love that company: look how ethical, prominent, and efficacious it is – a Triadic Organizational Reputation (TOR) scale (2018) Journal of Business Ethics, 153 (3), pp. 889-910; Ageeva, E., Melewar, T.C., Foroudi, P., Dennis, C., Jin, Z., Examining the influence of corporate website favorability on corporate image and corporate reputation: findings from fsQCA (2018) Journal of Business Research, 89, pp. 287-304; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Technological acquisitions and the innovation performance of acquiring firms: a longitudinal study (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 197-220; Ayers, D.J., Menachemi, N., Ramamonjiarivelo, Z., Matthews, M., Brooks, R.G., Adoption of electronic medical records: the role of network effects (2009) Journal of Product & Brand Management, 18 (2), pp. 127-135; Bachmann, R., Elstner, S., Sims, E.R., (2010) Uncertainty and economic activity, , www.nber.org/papers/w16143, NBER Working Paper 16143, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA; Barnett, M.L., Jermier, J.M., Lafferty, B.A., Corporate reputation: the definitional landscape (2006) Corporate Reputation Review, 9 (1), pp. 26-38; Barnett, M.L., Pollock, T.G., (2012) The Oxford Handbook of Corporate Reputation, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Basdeo, D.K., Smith, K.G., Grimm, C.M., Rindova, V.P., Derfus, P.J., The impact of market actions on firm reputation (2006) Strategic Management Journal, 27 (12), pp. 1205-1219; Benjamin, B.A., Podolny, J.M., Status, quality, and social order in the California wine industry (1999) Administrative Science Quarterly, 44 (3), pp. 563-589; Bhuta, S., Doshi, A., Doshi, U., Narvekar, M., A review of techniques for sentiment analysis of twitter data (2014) 2014 International Conference on Issues and Challenges in Intelligent Computing Techniques (ICICT), pp. 583-591. , IEEE; Biswas, D., Biswas, A., The diagnostic role of signals in the context of perceived risks in online shopping do signals matter more on the web?

One of the usages of blockchain is in digital currencies. Digital currency (cryptocurrency) is a new era for the global financial system. Cryptocurrencies draw significant attention from researchers because of their advantages. Although there are several risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of their transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to the safety and privacy of investors, just to name a few. To understand public opinions about cryptocurrency and speculative movements to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. It is also one of the essential steps in the analysis to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine the attitudes of social network users by analyzing the positivity and negativity of the comments about six cryptocurrencies. Results show that the positivity is higher than negativity, and there exist relations between price changes and attitudes. However, relations vary according to currency types. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain opinions of social network users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency. © 2020 IEEE.","Attitude Analysis; Cryptocurrency; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media",,"Tschorsch, F., Scheuermann, B., Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials, 18 (3), pp. 2084-2123. , thirdquarter; Harris, C.G., The risks and dangers of relying on blockchain technology in underdeveloped countries (2018) IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS), pp. 1-4. , April; Salman, T., Zolanvari, M., Erbad, A., Jain, R., Samaka, M., Security services using blockchains: A state of the art survey (2018) IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials; (2018), https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/, Bitcoin.

Because of its digital nature, Bitcoin cannot be valuated exclusively with fundamental approaches, which is why factors such as investor sentiment have become a common alternative to capture its performance. In this work, we studied whether and how the sale of Bitcoins from the insolvency assets of Mt.Gox, which represent about 1.1% of the current global total, relates to Bitcoin price movements. We used social media sentiment analysis of Twitter data to examine how investors are influenced in their decision to buy or sell Bitcoin when confronted with the trade actions of Nobuaki Kobayashi, the trustee in charge of the Mt.Gox case. We built a vector error correction model to analyse the long-run relationship between cointegrated variables. Our analysis confirms the positive association of Bitcoin performance with positive Twitter sentiment and tweet volume and the negative association with negative sentiment. We further found empirical evidence that Mt.Gox selloff events have a lasting negative impact on the Bitcoin price and that we can measure this effect by Twitter sentiment and tweet volume. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

With the increasingly large amount of social media data, how to effectively distinguish value-relevant information from noise remains an important question. We study this question by investigating the role of network cohesion in the relationship between social media sentiment and price changes in the Bitcoin market. As network cohesion is associated with information correlation within the discussion network, we hypothesize that less cohesive social media discussion networks are better at predicting the next-day returns than more cohesive networks. Both regression analyses and trading simulations based on data collected from Bitcointalk.org confirm our hypothesis. Our findings enrich the literature on the role of social media in financial markets and provide actionable insights for investors to trade based on social media signals. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bitcoin; financial technology; Fintech; network cohesion; Social media analytics",,"Adamic, L.A., Glance, N., (2005) The political blogosphere and the 2004 US election: Divided they blog. 3rd International Workshop on Link Discovery (LinkKDD), pp. 36-43. , and; Antweiler, W., Frank, M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

This is particularly true for tourism, which is undergoing significant changes due to the development of new technologies. The level of technology diffusion depends on several factors like the exchange of information among peers, and the attitude and shared perception among the contributors. The aim of the study is to explore the diffusion of technology in tourism with a specific focus on the social media discourse around new technologies. Thus, the paper investigates the level of interest in these new technologies analysing the information exchange occurring between individuals on Twitter in order to explore the influence of reciprocal networking. Design/methodology/approach: To capture the attitudes expressed in the industry, the study analyses the ongoing discourse on Twitter as a proxy for the participants “interest in new technologies. Through a social network analysis of the tweets and retweets conducted over a period of nine months, the research maps the level of information exchange about the diffusion of new technologies. Moreover, the sentiment analysis provides an interesting overview of the individuals” attitudes towards the awareness or the adoption of new technologies. Findings: Our analysis has provided several insights: (1) the information network on blockchain in tourism consists of participants who change very quickly over time (high turnover of accounts); (2) some contributors have an extremely important role in influencing the flow of information in the system (information centralization), they can have a generalist (discussing several topics) or a specialist (focusing on a specific topic) behaviour and this strategic choice influences their network's structure; (3) these central nodes also have an impact on the definition of positive and negative sentiment towards a topic (sentiment influencer). Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to the literature on technology diffusion, by focusing on one of the preconditions of diffusion that is the shared positive attitude towards technological innovation. More specifically, we adopt a network-based approach, which is useful to explain the level of information exchange and the public discourse that can impact the shared perception and attitude towards technological innovation. The study also highlights the role of knowledge brokers in influencing this public discourse. Future studies can deepen the association between positive perception, higher levels of information exchange and increasing usage of specific technologies. Our results also suggest further exploring the opportunity to combine social media data and other sources of information to shed more light on the technological innovation diffusion processes. Practical implications: This paper shows how practitioners can benefit from the analysis of information exchange about new technologies in tourism adopting a network perspective with the aim of understanding the level of influence among contributors. Moreover, the increasing interest in blockchain technology and the potential combination between social media data and other sources of information can offer promising insights. Social implications: The present study explores the level of technology diffusion through the analysis of information exchange on social media (Twitter). Furthermore, the dynamics of individual user behaviour offers a better understanding about media effects. Originality/value: While previous research is focused on the users' perception towards the development of new technologies in tourism, the aim of this study is to investigate the dynamics behind the level of diffusion of information and awareness about these new technologies, which still represents an unexplored area of research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Perception; Social media; Social network analysis; Technology adoption; Technology diffusion; Tourism",,"Aggarwal, C.C., An introduction to social network data analytics (2011) Social Network Data Analytics, pp. 1-15. , Springer, Boston, MA; Araujo, T., Neijens, P., Vliegenthart, R., Getting the word out on twitter: the role of influentials, information brokers and strong ties in building word-of-mouth for brands (2017) International Journal of Advertising, 36 (3), pp. 496-513; Arenas, A., Goh, J., Urueña, A., How does IT affect design centricity approaches: evidence from Spain's smart tourism ecosystem (2019) International Journal of Information Management, 45, pp. 149-162; Arthur, W.B., Competing technologies, increasing returns, and lock-in by historical events (1989) The Economic Journal, 99 (394), pp. 116-131; Asur, S., Huberman, B.A., (2010), pp. 492-499. , Predicting the future with social media, IEEE/WIC/ACM international conference on web intelligence and intelligent agent technology, Toronto, ON; Bae, Y., Lee, H., Sentiment analysis of twitter audiences: measuring the positive or negative influence of popular twitterers (2012) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 63 (12), pp. 2521-2535; Bandura, A., The explanatory and predictive scope of self-efficacy theory (1986) Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 4 (3), pp. 359-373; Bass, F.M., A new product growth for model consumer durables (1969) Management Science, 15 (5), pp. 215-227; Bian, J., Yoshigoe, K., Hicks, A., Yuan, J., He, Z., Xie, M., Guo, Y., Modave, F., Mining twitter to assess the public perception of the ‘internet of things' (2016) PloS One, 11, p. 7; Bolici, F., Giustiniano, L., Design science and eTrust: designing organizational artifacts as nexus of social and technical interactions (2013) Organizational Change and Information Systems, pp. 177-190. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; Bollen, J., Mao, H., Zeng, X., Twitter mood predicts the stock market (2011) Journal of Computational Science, 2 (1), pp. 1-8; Bonchi, F., Castillo, C., Gionis, A., Jaimes, A., Social network analysis and mining for business applications (2011) ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2, p. 3; Boucher, P., Nascimento, S., Kritikos, M., How blockchain technology could change our lives (2017) European Parliamentary Research Service, Scientific Foresight Unit, pp. 1-28. , European Parliament, Brussels; Buhalis, D., Strategic use of information technologies in the tourism industry (1998) Tourism Management, 19 (5), pp. 409-421; Buhalis, D., Law, R., Progress in information technology and tourism management: 20 years on and 10 years after the Internet—the state of eTourism research (2008) Tourism Management, 29 (4), pp. 609-623; Buhalis, D., O'Connor, P., Information communication technology revolutionizing tourism (2005) Tourism Recreation Research, 30 (3), pp. 7-16; Buhalis, D., Sinarta, Y., Real-time co-creation and nowness service: lessons from tourism and hospitality (2019) Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 36 (5), pp. 563-582; Burt, R.S., (1992) Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition, , University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigns Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership Historical Research ReferenceEntrepreneurship, Harvard Univ.

In algorithmic trading, an innovative approach to integrate machine learning can provide data-driven solutions to help people invest with minimal risk and maximum return. This study explores various machine learning techniques to model the nonlinear relationship between bitcoin price and social sentiment data and predict price values with some lead time. Also, the cryptocurrency market is very volatile and lack strict governing bodies and regulators across regions making it more complex and challenging to predict the prices. Through the analysis, it is found that the sentiment data model is superior in capturing the nonlinear relationship compared to the conventional methods of technical indicators and decision trees, while the neural network models are robust and offer better accuracy in predicting the bitcoin price. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any government agencies resulting in prices being strongly influenced by public opinion. Understanding the relationship between cryptocurrency prices and the public sentiment can lead to improved predictions of price movement. In this paper, we give an exploratory analysis of a network of 24 Reddit communities related to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to analyze Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements. We engineer a set of 112 time series features from submissions and comments made on the selected subreddits, run Granger causality tests on engineered time series against cryptocurrency price movements, and use these time series to forecast the cryptocurrency price movements using classification models. Results from these models support the Granger causality test results showing that with only lagged price values and lagged values from a single Reddit data derived feature, the direction of Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements can be predicted with 74.2% and 73.1% accuracy respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; Gradient Boosting Machines; Granger causality; PageRank; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis",,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System; Crosby, M., Pattanayak, P., Verma, S., Kalyanaraman, V., Blockchain technology: Beyond bitcoin (2016) Applied Innovation, 2 (6-10), p. 71; Elbahrawy, A., Alessandretti, L., Kandler, A., Pastor-Satorras, R., Baronchelli, A., Evolutionary dynamics of the cryptocurrency market (2017) Royal Society Open Science, 4 (11), p. 170623; Phillips, R.C., Gorse, D., Cryptocurrency price drivers: Wavelet coherence analysis revisited (2018) PloS One, 13 (4), p. e0195200; Newman, M.E., Power laws, pareto distributions and zipf's law (2005) Contemporary Physics, 46 (5), pp. 323-351; Nasir, M.A., Huynh, T.L.D., Nguyen, S.P., Duong, D., Forecasting cryptocurrency returns and volume using search engines (2019) Financial Innovation, 5 (1), p. 2; Steinert, L., Herff, C., Predicting altcoin returns using social media (2018) PloS One, 13 (12), p. e0208119; Matta, M., Lunesu, I., Marchesi, M., Bitcoin spread prediction using social and web search media (2015) UMAP Workshops, pp. 1-10; Linton, M., Teo, E.G.S., Bommes, E., Chen, C., Härdle, W.K., Dynamic topic modelling for cryptocurrency community forums (2017) Applied Quantitative Finance, pp. 355-372. , Springer; Kim, Y.B., Kim, J.G., Kim, W., Im, J.H., Kim, T.H., Kang, S.J., Kim, C.H., Predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency transactions based on user comments and replies (2016) PloS One, 11 (8), p. e0161197; Li, T.R., Chamrajnagar, A.S., Fong, X.R., Rizik, N.R., Fu, F., (2018) Sentiment-based Prediction of Alternative Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations Using Gradient Boosting Tree Model; Park, A., Conway, M., Chen, A.T., Examining thematic similarity, difference, and membership in three online mental health communities from reddit: A text mining and visualization approach (2018) Computers in Human Behavior, 78, pp. 98-112; Choi, D., Han, J., Chung, T., Ahn, Y.-Y., Chun, B.-G., Kwon, T.T., Characterizing conversation patterns in reddit: From the perspectives of content properties and user participation behaviors (2015) Proceedings of the 2015 Acm on Conference on Online Social Networks.

However, there has been a lack of solutions that can support real-time price prediction to cope with high currency volatility, handle massive heterogeneous data volumes, including social media sentiments, while supporting fault tolerance and persistence in real time, and provide real-time adaptation of learning algorithms to cope with new price and sentiment data. In this paper we introduce KryptoOracle, a novel real-time and adaptive cryptocurrency price prediction platform based on Twitter sentiments. The integrative and modular platform is based on (i) a Spark-based architecture which handles the large volume of incoming data in a persistent and fault tolerant way; (ii) an approach that supports sentiment analysis which can respond to large amounts of natural language processing queries in real time; and (iii) a predictive method grounded on online learning in which a model adapts its weights to cope with new prices and sentiments. Besides providing an architectural design, the paper also describes the KryptoOracle platform implementation and experimental evaluation. Overall, the proposed platform can help accelerate decision-making, uncover new opportunities and provide more timely insights based on the available and ever-larger financial data volume and variety. © 2019 IEEE.","cryptocurrency; machine learning; price prediction; real time; sentiment analysis; social media; software platform; Spark",,"Cryptocurrency-what Is A Cryptocurrency ?, , https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp; Cryptolization-cryptocurrency Market Cap Analysis, , https://cryptolization.com; Lamon, C., Nielsen, E., Redondo, E., Cryptocurrency price prediction using news and social media sentiment (2017) SMU Data Sci.

Consequently, it would be attractive for designers and policy-makers in this area to make out what social media users think about them on Twitter. The purpose of this study is to investigate the social opinions about different kinds of crypto-currencies and tune the best-customized classification technique to categorize the tweets based on sentiments. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilized a lexicon-based approach for analyzing the reviews on a wide range of crypto-currencies over Twitter data to measure positive, negative or neutral sentiments; in addition, the end result of sentiments played a training role to train a supervised technique, which can predict the sentiment loading of tweets about the main crypto-currencies. Findings: The findings further prove that more than 50 per cent of people have positive beliefs about crypto-currencies. Furthermore, this paper confirms that marketers can predict the sentiment of tweets about these crypto-currencies with high accuracy if they use appropriate classification techniques like support vector machine (SVM). Practical implications: Considering the growing interest in crypto-currencies (Bitcoin, Cardano, Ethereum, Litcoin and Ripple), the findings of this paper have a remarkable value for enterprises in the financial area to obtain the promised benefits of social media analysis at work. In addition, this paper helps crypto-currencies vendors analyze public opinion in social media platforms. In this sense, the current paper strengthens our understanding of what happens in social media for crypto-currencies. Originality/value: For managers and decision-makers, this paper suggests that the news and campaign for their crypto in Twitter would affect people’s perspectives in a good manner. Because of this fact, the firms, investing in these crypto-currencies, could apply the social media as a magnifier for their promotional activities. The findings steer the market managers to see social media as a predictor tool, which can analyze the market through understanding the opinions of users of Twitter. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Classification; Crypto-currencies; Sentiment analysis; Twitter",,"Ahmed, S., Jaidka, K., Cho, J., The 2014 Indian elections on twitter: a comparison of campaign strategies of political parties (2016) Telematics and Informatics, 33 (4), pp. 1071-1087; Angel, J.J., McCabe, D., The ethics of payments: paper, plastic, or Bitcoin?

Furthermore, we analyse the effect of the sentiment of these news and other factors (events) on the market efficiency in the high frequency setting, and provide a simple event analysis to investigate whether specific factors affect the market efficiency/inefficiency. The results show that the sentiment and types of news and events may not be significant factor in determining the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptive market hypothesis; Bitcoin; Efficient market hypothesis; Ethereum; Martingale difference hypothesis",,"Alvarez-Ramirez, J., Rodriguez, E., Ibarra-Valdez, C., Long-range correlations and asymmetry in the bitcoin market (2018) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 492, pp. 948-955; Al-Yahyaee, K.H., Mensi, W., Yoon, S.M., Effciency, multifractality, and the long-memory property of the bitcoin market: A comparative analysis with stock, currency, and gold markets (2018) Finance Research Letters; Bariviera, A.F., The inefficiency of bitcoin revisited: A dynamic approach (2017) Economics Letters, 161, pp. 1-4; https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42457983, BBC News. 2017.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and they form an emerging market that is different from stocks. At present, there is already much work around the stock price prediction using news articles, but there are few papers on the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we aim to research the effects of news articles on bitcoin prices. We extract features from news articles with both commonly used text feature extraction algorithms (e.g., N-Gram and TF-IDF) and SentiGraph, which is a novel text representation method we propose. SentiGraph takes advantages of sentiment analysis and transforms a news article into a graph. Compared with previous feature extraction methods, our experiment results show that this new approach is superior on the prediction accuracy, which also demonstrates the impacts of news articles on the bitcoin price. © 2019 IEEE.","Bitcoin Price Trends; Machine Learning; Text Mining","2018YFB0803405

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models. © 2019 by the authors.","Cryptocurrencies; Machine learning; Price movement; Sentiment analysis",,"Ferreira, M., Rodrigues, S., Reis, C.I., Maximiano, M., Blockchain: A Tale of Two Applications (2018) Appl.

Machine learning models have been used to build robust models to model the above task. Ensemble methods are one of them resulting better than single supervised method. We have used generative and discriminative classifiers to create the stack, particularly 3 generative and 6 discriminative classifiers and optimized over one-layer Neural Network to model the direction of price cryptocurrencies. Features used are technical indicators not limited to trend, momentum, volume, volatility indicators and sentiment indicators. For Cross validation, Purged Walk forward cross validation has been used. In terms of accuracy, we have done comparative analysis of the performance of Ensemble method with Stacking and individual models.

Amongst them, we focus on the question of how is the price of digital currencies affected, which is a natural question especially when considering the price roller-coaster we witnessed for bitcoin in 2017-2018. We work under the hypothesis that price is affected by the web footprint of influential people, we refer to them as crypto-influencers. In this paper we provide neural models for predicting bitcoin price. We compare what happens when the model is fed only with recent price history versus what happens when fed, in addition, with a measure of the positivity or negativity of the sayings of these influencers, measured through a sentiment analysis of their twitter posts. We show preliminary evidence that twitter data should indeed help to predict the price of bitcoin, even though the measures we use in this paper have a lot of room for refinement. In particular, we also discuss the challenges of measuring the correct sensation of these posts, and discuss the work that should help improving our discoveries even further. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","Bitcoin; Price Prediction; Recurrent Neural Networks; Sentiment Analysis; Twitter",,"Zhang, X.Z.Y., Wang, S., Yao, Y., Fanga, B., Yu, P.S., (2018) Improving Stock Market Prediction Via Heterogeneous Information Fusion; Zhang, X., Li, Y., Wang, S., Fang, B., Yu, P.S., (2018) Enhancing Stock Market Prediction with Extended Coupled Hidden Markov Model over Multi-Sourced Data; Li, T., Jing, B., Ying, N., Yu, X., (2017) Adaptive Scaling; Zhou, X., Pan, Z., Hu, G., Tang, S., Zhao, C., (2018) Stock Market Prediction on High-Frequency Data Using Generative Adversarial Nets; Bandara, K., Shi, P., Bergmeir, C., Hewamalage, H., Tran, Q., Seaman, B., (2019) Sales Demand Forecast in E-Commerce Using a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Methodology; Karevan, Z., Suykens, J.A.K., (2018) Spatio-Temporal Stacked LSTM for Temperature Prediction in Weather Forecasting; Girkar, U.M., Uchimido, R., Lehman, L.-W.H., Szolovits, P., Celi, L., Weng, W.-H., (2018) Predicting Blood Pressure Response to Fluid Bolus Therapy Using Attention-Based Neural Networks for Clinical Interpretability; Nguyen, D.T., Sharma, S., Schulz, H., Asri, L.E., (2018) From FiLM to Video: Multi-Turn Question Answering with Multi-Modal Context; Jung, H., Han, M., Kang, M., Hwang, S., (2018) Learning What to Remember: Long-Term Episodic Memory Networks for Learning from Streaming Data; Vidya Prasad, K., Akarsh, S., Vinayakumar, R., Soman, K.P., (2019) A Deep Learning Approach for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects; Wehbe, B., Arriaga, O., Krell, M.M., Kirchner, F., (2018) Learning of Multi-Context Models for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; Zhong, G., Lin, X., Chen, K., (2018) Long Short-Term Attention; Bahdanau, D., Serdyuk, D., Brakel, P., Ke, N.R., Chorowski, J., Courville, A., Bengio, Y., (2016) Task Loss Estimation for Sequence Prediction; Xu, J., Zhang, Z., Friedman, T., Liang, Y., Van Den Broeck, G., (2018) A Semantic Loss Function for Deep Learning with Symbolic Knowledge; Welleck, S., Yao, Z., Gai, Y., Mao, J., Zhang, Z., Cho, K., (2017) Loss Functions for Multiset Prediction; Peters, M.E., Neumann, M., Iyyer, M., Gardner, M., Clark, C., Lee, K., Zettlemoyer, L., (2018) Deep Contextualized Word Representations; Howard, J., Ruder, S., (2018) Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for Text Classification; Joshi, S., Deshpande, D., (2018) Twitter Sentiment Analysis System; Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., Nakov, P., (2017) SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter; Baccianella, S., Esuli, A., Sebastiani, F., (2006) SentiWordNet 3.0: An Enhanced Lexical Resource for Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining; Pérez, D., Crypto-influencers algorithm (2018) Url =, , https://github.com/dperezrada/crypto-influencers, lastaccessed on June 23, 2018; Nakamoto, S., (2018) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System; Rada, D.P., (2018) Personal Communication, , 01-22; Van Der Burgt, J., (2018) Making Sense of Bitcoin Price Levels",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","English",Conference Paper,Scopus

Furthermore, the study examined users' sentiments towards the transaction process of the KeepKey wallet. The results illustrate that the majority of the participants could detect some but not all MITM attacks. Moreover, there were a considerable number of successful MITM attacks in the experiment.

It bridges the gap between findings in initial public offering (IPO) literature and empirical results from ICOs. Design/methodology/approach: The sample set consists of 279 ICOs between April 2013 and January 2018. A regression analysis is performed with data from the ICOs. Findings: The results show an average level of underpricing of ICOs of 123 percent in the USA and 97 percent in the other countries. The results for the US ICOs are significantly higher than for US IPOs on average and also higher than US IPOs at the beginning of the dot.com bubble. The authors also study the determinants of ICO underpricing. The authors use proxies based on asymmetric information from the IPO literature as well as ICO-related variables. First-day trading volume and a good sentiment on the ICO market go together with more ICO underpricing. Moreover, hot markets make first-day investors to benefit less. Finally, companies that use a large issue size or a pre-ICO (a sale of cryptocurrencies before the ICO) leave less money on the table. Research limitations/implications: A first restriction is that the authors focus on ICOs and not on crowdfunding, though there are similarities in that both of them are novel ways to finance projects. A second restriction is that the authors had to decide on the definition of a listing day. Cryptocurrencies are traded on many exchanges, and if the exchange is tailored to the cryptocurrency itself, the data on, e.g., close prices are not necessarily to be trusted. The authors, therefore, decided to use close price data from coinmarketcap.com, which requires a listing on two exchanges. This choice implies that there may have been trades before the listing day itself. A third restriction arises from the relative newness of the ICO phenomenon. The authors gathered data on underpricing from coinmarketcap.com and combined that with project information from icobench.com. However, the data were not simply matched and they required manual adjustments based on several other sources. The authors hope that in due time data on ICOs will be as adequate as data on IPOs and that they become more readily available. It might help if regulators or the crypto community would institute publication requirements. Adherence to such requirements would also reduce the extent of fraud and of asymmetric information, so that solid issuers with good projects might benefit from less underpricing. Practical implications: The research may help in reducing underpricing, as the authors find that issuers can reduce it by holding a pre-ICO and by considering larger issue sizes. If they do so, investors will get fewer opportunities to benefit from underpricing. Investors can, nevertheless, also profit from the knowledge generated in this paper. When market sentiment is positive and first-day trading volume is expected to be high, investing in ICOs is likely to give them higher first-day returns. Finally, the authors hope that this paper will serve as a basis for further research into the exciting and dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value: There is hardly any research on underpricing of ICOs. The paper is interesting for its table with a brief comparison of ICOs and IPOs.

Big companies are investing in this technology. However, some established companies still hesitate to use it. According to them, it is a volatile trend which will fade up eventually. There is no such authority which will provide them feasibility information. So, investors can be helped by providing them feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The crawled data for other cryptocurrencies are much insufficient, so that are excluded from the study. In the proposed methodology, the top locations where cryptocurrency is widely used are identified, then in that particular locations' users concerns along with their sentiment analyses are investigated. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden show positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment which ranks as the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the noteworthy terms found are legitimacy, authorization rules, volatility, profit, investment, and fluctuations. Which describe the users' concerns/ interests' about cryptocurrency. Investors can focus on all these areas during business. These subtopics can help business experts to evolve their businesses' and to make them more sustainable on the basis of public perception. © 2019 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency world; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Sentiment analysis; Topic modeling; User interests' detection",,"Social Media-Statistics & Facts | Statista, , https://www.statista.com/topics/1164/social-networks/, [Accessed: 31-Mar-2018]; Aslam, S., Twitter by the numbers: Stats, demographics & fun facts (2017) Omnicore, , https://www.omnicoreagency.com/twitter-statistics/, [Accessed: 31-Mar-2018]; Katsiampa, P., Volatility estimation for bitcoin: A comparison of garch models (2017) Econ.

Because of its possible applications, cryptocurrency draws significant attention from researchers. Although there are a number of risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost 20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to safety and privacy, just to name a few. In order to understand public opinion about cryptocurrency and to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. One of the most important steps in the analysis is to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine education levels of investors or users who are interested in eight cryptocurrencies by using seven readability techniques on Reddit comments as a part of profiling. Results show that the education levels of users are approximately 60% in middle school, 30% in high school, and 10% in other levels according to the average of the seven readability technique results. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain profile information about the users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency. © 2018 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency; Profile Analysis; Readability; Social Media",,"Tschorsch, F., Scheuermann, B., Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies (2016) IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials, 18 (3), pp. 2084-2123. , thirdquarter; Harris, C.G., The risks and dangers of relying on blockchain technology in underdeveloped countries (2018) NOMS 2018-2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium, pp. 1-4. , April; Salman, T., Zolanvari, M., Erbad, A., Jain, R., Samaka, M., Security services using blockchains: A state of the art survey (2018) IEEE Communications Surveys Tutorials; (2018), https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/, Bitcoin.

It is shown that, in contrast to earlier findings, the relationship between cryptocurrency price movements and internet search volumes obtained from Google Trends is no longer consistently positive, with strong negative correlations detected for Bitcoin and Ethereum during June 2018. Sentiment extracted from cryptocurrency investment groups on Telegram is found to be positively correlated to Bitcoin and Ethereum price movements, particularly during periods of elevated volatility. The number of messages posted on a Bitcoin-themed Telegram group is found to be an indicator of Bitcoin price action in the subsequent week. A long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is developed to predict the direction of cryptocurrency prices using data obtained from Google Trends and Telegram. It is shown that Telegram data is a better predictor of the direction of the Bitcoin market than Google Trends. The converse is true for Ethereum.

As bitcoin received increased attention, researchers have examined popular sentiment as a predictor of bitcoin price fluctuation. However, the popular sentiment may differ from the sentiment of financial professionals. We ask whether the presence and news sentiment from prestigious business journals would affect the bitcoin return. We collected the daily bitcoin price data from 01/01/2017 to 03/31/2018 from the third-party cryptocurrency exchange website CoinMarketCap. The headlines of news mentioning bitcoin on Wall Street Journal and Financial Times are collected from LexisNexis Database. We calculated the sentiment embedded in the news headlines using a bag-of-words model and a dictionary-based approach. We estimate a regression of financial news sentiment on bitcoin daily return. Our main findings are that positive sentiment contributes significantly negatively to bitcoin return on the same day; negative sentiment day contributes positively, although not significantly. We interpret these findings through the disposition effect that, investors tend to sell high-performed assets and hold underperformed assets. The findings extend our understanding of disposition effect to the cryptocurrency market, and we plan to further examine if there is evidence of the disposition effect. © 2019 Association for Information Systems.

With Google search volumes as a baseline, we find that Reddit submissions are both correlated with Google and have a comparable relationship with a variety of bitcoin metrics, using Spearman’s rho. Reddit provides complete access to the text of submissions. Rather than associating sentiment with market activity, we describe the DDPWI method for finding specific ‘price dynamic’ words associated with changes in the bitcoin pricing pattern through 2017 and 2018. We assess the significance of these changes using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests with Bonferroni corrections. These price dynamic words are used to pull out associated words in the submissions thereby providing the context to their use. For example, the price dynamic word ‘ban’, which became significantly higher in frequency as prices fell, occurred in the context of both government regulation and internet companies banning cryptocurrency adverts. This approach could be used more generally to look at social media and discussion forums at a granular level identifying specific words that impact the metric under investigation rather than overall sentiment. © 2019 The Authors.

It has attracted much public attention due to its innovative technology and its high currency exchange rate volatility. In this paper, Bitcoin’s exchange rate movement from 2011 to 2018 and its relationship with the global financial markets are explored using an EGARCH framework. The results are as follows. First, fundamentals and Bitcoin-related specific events play a critical role in the formation of its exchange rate. Second, the impact on Bitcoin of regulation-related events indicates that market sentiment responds to market regulation statements. Third, news coverage is an essential factor in driving its volatility. Fourth, Bitcoin can be a hedge in times of low uncertainty in global financial markets and can also serve as a safe haven against high economic uncertainty worldwide, but with increasing global financial uncertainty, it is likely to move with the markets and therefore cannot serve as a hedge or safe haven against stock market crashes. Lastly, the positive effect of global expansionary monetary policy on Bitcoin’s exchange rate is marginal enough to rule out the involvement of central banks worldwide in the inflation of Bitcoin’s exchange rate over the years, as may have been the case with many asset prices after the 2008 US financial crisis. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bitcoin; EGARCH; Event analysis; Financial markets; Reuters news","","Al-Khazali, O., Elie, B., Roubaud, D., The impact of positive and negative macroeconomic news surprises: Gold versus Bitcoin (2018) Econ Bull, 38 (1), pp. 373-382. , http://www.accessecon.com/Pubs/EB/2018/Volume38/EB-18-V38-I1-P36.pdf, Retrieved from, Accessed 23 May 2019; Ali, R., Barrdear, J., Clews, R., Southgate, J., The economics of digital currencies (2014) Bank Engl Q Bull, 54 (3), pp. 276-286. , http://www.accessecon.com/Pubs/EB/2018/Volume38/EB-18-V38-I1-P36.pdf, Retrieved from, Accessed 23 May 2019; Allison, P.D., Missing data: quantitative applications in the social sciences (2002) Br J Math Stat Psychol, 55 (1), pp. 193-196; Amihud, Y., Illiquidity and stock returns: cross-section and time-series effects (2002) J Financ Mark, 5 (1), pp. 31-56; Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Diebold, F.X., Vega, C., Micro effects of macro announcements: real-time price discovery in foreign exchange (2003) Am Econ Rev, 93 (1), pp. 38-62; Ané, T., Geman, H., Order flow, transaction clock, and normality of asset returns (2000) J Finance, 55 (5), pp. 2259-2284; Aouadi, A., Arouri, M., Teulon, F., Investor attention and stock market activity: evidence from France (2013) Econ Model, 35, pp. 674-681; Ardia, D., Bluteau, K., RÃijede, M., Regime changes in Bitcoin GARCH volatility dynamics (2018) Finance Res Lett; Baba, Y., Engle, R., Kraft, D., Kroner, K., (1990) Multivariate Simultaneous Generalized ARCH, Mimeo, , Department of Economics, University of California, San Diego; Baek, C., Elbeck, M., Bitcoins as an investment or speculative vehicle? a first look (2015) Appl Econ Lett, 22 (1), pp. 30-34; Baker, S.R., Bloom, N., Davis, S.J., Measuring economic policy uncertainty (2016) Q J Econ, 131 (4), pp. 1593-1636; Balcilar, M., Bouri, E., Gupta, R., Roubaud, D., Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility? a quantiles-based approach (2017) Econ Model, 64, pp. 74-81; Balcilar, M., Gupta, R., Segnon, M., (2016) The Role of Economic Policy Uncertainty in Predicting U.S. Recessions: A Mixed-Frequency Markov-Switching Vector Autoregressive Approach, , https://doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-27, Discussion Paper No. 2016-14, Kiel Institute for the World Economy; Bank, M., Larch, M., Peter, G., Google search volume and its influence on liquidity and returns of German stocks (2011) Financ Mark Portf Manag, 25 (3), pp. 239-264; (2014) Bank of Canada Review, , https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/boc-review-spring14.pdf, Spring 2014.

Understanding how personal characteristics affect risk attitudes is a significant question. This paper develops the Merton risk model in the context of Modern Portfolio Theory. The statistical methods are analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Mann-Whitney statistic tests for an individual agent with an infinite continuous horizon of investment. Research in this field has produced various perplexing results. It is the first research about risk sentiment of Russian investors. The authors study individuals in Russia and factors for decision making of individual investors such as age, field of work, salary, salary stability, income, risk sentiment, savings. The individuals are of special interest for several reasons. Also, 5-years exchange traded funds (ETF) and bitcoin performance were analyzed to find potential risks. Based on statistics of risk sentiment and ETF performance, it is found that, in general, the high-risk investors have lower income and lower age. The paper suggests that individual risk in young age often becomes more willing, but older individual investor become less risk-seeking. The authors propose the model for choosing optimal asset allocation of exchange-traded funds. © Alexey Mikhaylov, Natalia Sokolinskaya, Evgeny Lopatin, 2019","Asset allocation; Decision making; Loss perception; Modern Portfolio Theory; Profit perception; Risk attitude",,"Ackert, L., Charupat, N., Church, B., Deaves, R., An experimental examination of the house money effect in a multi-period setting (2006) Experimental Economics, 9 (1), pp. 5-16. , https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10683-006-1467-1, Retrieved from; Bajtelsmit, V., Bernasek, A., Why do women invest differently than men?

Literature shows that business analysts always tend to use new technologies and investigate their risks. Some researchers predicted the price fluctuations and investigated the risk of cryptocurrency and blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which provides the feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword. This shows the mutual relationship among different cryptocurrencies and public's concerns about cryptocurrencies. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cryptocurrency world; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Sentiment analysis; Topic modeling; User interests' detection",,"Hussain, S., Keung, J., Sohail, M.K., Ilahi, M., Khan, A.A., Automated framework for classification and selection of software design patterns (2018) Applied Soft Computing, , October; Hussain, S., Implications of deep learning for the automation of design patterns organization (2017) Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing; Lamon, C., Nielsen, E., Redondo, E., (2017) Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using News and Social Media Sentiment; Linton, W.K.H.M., Teo, E.G.S., Bommes, E., (2017) Dynamic Topic-Modelling for Cryptocurrency Community Forums, pp. 355-372. , C.

The growth of this market is to a large extent associated with an increase in the number of initial coin offerings, also known as ICOs, as well as the volume of funds raised during the placement of new cryptocurrencies. In this article, we consider the relationship between the returns of cryptocurrencies emerged through ICOs and traded on specialized exchanges and various market factors as well as we examine the risk factors associated with the failure of cryptocurrency projects expressed in the delisting of their tokens or in a critical drop in their value. As part of the regression analysis, we showed that, in full accordance with the available literature, the returns of cryptocurrencies are not related to traditional factors of the financial market. However, sentiments in the cryptocurrency market itself, proxied by Bitcoin's returns, have a significant impact on long-term profitability, as well as sentiment in the market of Internet companies stocks. Moreover, the latter play an important role in relation to new tokens entering the market. We also showed that sentiment in the cryptocurrency market is important for the survival of cryptocurrencies. The token entering the market during periods of rising Bitcoin and increasing number of ICOs significantly reduces the chances of its survival. The results of this article are also relevant for the Russian market, since Russian companies together occupy the fourth place in the world in the number of ICOs conducted. © 2019 Publishing House of the Higher School of Economics.

Statistics from Twitter support this statement where, approximately 1,500 Tweets about Bitcoin alone is recorded per hour. Consequently, many people are beginning to become more aware and accepting of the nature of digital currencies, and traders in particular seek to know how they can make profitable crypto-coin trades and investments. Although a number of research projects have been undertaken to develop systems that can effectively predict price movements in the cryptocurrency market, they display significant efficiency gaps, which this paper further explores. The authors then attempt to learn from past studies and construct a more holistic approach to a predictive price model for the cryptocurrency market. This focuses on assessing key factors that affect the volatility of the market - public perception, trading data, historic price data, and the interdependencies between Bitcoin and Altcoins - and how they can be best utilized from a technological aspect by applying sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, to increase the efficiency of the process. © 2018 IEEE.","Cryptocurrency Price Prediction; Machine Learning; Predictive Models; Sentiment Analysis",,"30 Bitcoin Hashtags Popular on Twitter | RiteTag: Find the Best Hashtags, , https://ritetag.com/best-hashtags-for/bitcoin, Accessed: 2017-12-20; D'Alfonso, A., Peter Langer, Z.V., The future of cryptocurrency (2016) International Security, 7 (5), pp. 7-45; Anantwar, S.G., Shelke, R.R., Simplified approach of ann: Strengths and weakness (2012) International Journal of Engineering and Innovative Technology (IJEIT), 1 (4), pp. 73-77; Byvatov, E., Comparison of support vector machine and artificial neural network systems for drug/nondrug classification (2003) Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling., 43 (6), pp. 1882-1889. , https://doi.org/10.1021/ci0341161; Ciaian, P., (2016) Virtual Relationships: Short-and Long-run Evidence from BitCoin and Altcoin Markets.; CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations, , https://coinmarketcap.com/, Accessed: 2017-07-22; Definitive Portal for Social Media Statistics Globally | Socialbakers, , https://www.socialbakers.com/statistics/, Accessed: 2017-08-28; Ethereum-Explore-Google Trends, , https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Ethereum, Accessed: 2017-12-17; Greaves, A., Au, B., (2015) Using the Bitcoin Transaction Graph to Predict the Price of Bitcoin.; Joachims, T., Text categorization with support vector machines: Learning with many relevant features (1998) Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)., 1398, pp. 137-142. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13928716, 1998; Kim, B.Y., Predicting fluctuations in cryptocurrency transactions based on user comments and replies (2016) PLoS ONE., 11 (8), pp. 1-17. , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161197; Pang, B., Lee, L., (2008) Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis; Patel, J., Predicting stock and stock price index movement using Trend Deterministic Data Preparation and machine learning techniques (2015) Expert Systems with Applications., 42 (1), pp. 259-268. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.040; Rowlands, J., (2014) Bitcoin Algorithmic Trading Bot, , April 2014; Statnikov, A., A comprehensive comparison of random forests and support vector machines for microarray-based cancer classification (2008) BMC Bioinformatics., 9 (1), p. 319. , https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-319; Yang, Y., Webb, G.I., (2001) Proportional K-Interval Discretization for Naive-Bayes Classifiers., pp. 564-575. , 2001",,"IEEE Computer Society","English",Conference Paper,Scopus

Among the other cryptocurrencies available in the market, Bitcoin cryptocurrency is the most valuable and famous currency. A large number of people discuss about the Bitcoin currency on the internet and social media platforms as well. These discussions help in determining the importance of Bitcoin in terms of users’ discussions about Bitcoin and can help in determining the value of Bitcoin in terms of people point of views about the topic. In this paper, sentiment analysis of the tweets of users on the topic of Bitcoin has been carried out. For this purpose, real-world twitter data set of Bitcoins is used. The data set has been divided into five separate sections for better comparative analysis, including overall extensive data analysis regarding tweets, retweets, tweets with mentions, tweets containing external links and also about the users who discuss regarding cryptocurrency of Bitcoin. A framework for sentiment analysis is proposed on the basis of Naïve Bayes sentiment classification algorithms which is widely used as a better option for text data. The proposed framework is capable to perform sentiment analysis of the tweets data. The results resemble that users’ opinions are on the high positive side about Bitcoins and people mostly people represent the positive sentiment about Bitcoins. The results are evaluated using the standard performance evaluation measures including precision, recall, f1- score and accuracy. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Bitcoin; Classification; Machine learning; Naïve bayes; Proposed framework; Sentiment analysis; Users’ opinions",,"Phillips, R.C., Gorse, D., Predicting cryptocurrency price bubbles using social media data and epidemic modelling (2017) 2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI), pp. 1-7; Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system; Conti, M.S.K.E., Lal, C., Ruj, S., A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Bitcoin (2018) IEEE Commun.

What determines its valuation is an important open question with far-reaching business and policy implications. Building on information systems and finance literature, we examine the dynamic interactions between social media and the monetary value of bitcoin using textual analysis and vector error correction models. We show that more bullish forum posts are associated with higher future bitcoin values. Interestingly, social media’s effects on bitcoin are driven primarily by the silent majority, the 95 percent of users who are less active and whose contributions amount to less than 40 percent of total messages. In addition, messages on an Internet forum, relative to tweets, have a stronger impact on future bitcoin value. Overall, our findings reveal that social media sentiment is an important predictor in determining bitcoin’s valuation, but not all social media messages are of equal impact. This study offers new insights into the digital currency market and the economic impact of social media.

Because some researchers argued that the Bitcoin value is also determined by perception of users and investors, this paper examines how. Design/methodology/approach: The database of relative news articles as well as blog posts has been collected for the purpose of this research. Hence, each article has been given a sentiment score depending on the negative and positive words used in the article. Findings: This paper has identified that interaction between media sentiment and the Bitcoin price exists, and that there is a tendency for investors to overreact on news in a short period of time. Originality/value: While sentiment analysis of Twitter posts as a predictor of the Bitcoin price has been conducted in the past, this research does not have any analog because psycho-semantic dictionaries have not been applied earlier in the Bitcoin research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Lexicon-based sentiment analysis; Market efficiency","G055515N","Alstyne, M.V., Why bitcoin has value (2014) Communications of the ACM, 57 (5), pp. 30-32. , https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/5/174354-why-bitcoin-has-value/abstract; Brooke, J., (2009), A semantic approach to automated text sentiment analysis; Cambria, E., Schuller, B., Xia, Y., Havasi, C., New avenues in opinion mining and sentiment analysis (2013) IEEE Intelligent Systems, 28 (2), pp. 15-21; Engelberg, E.J., Parsons, A.C., (2011) The causal impact of media in financial markets, 66 (1), pp. 67-97; Garcia, D., Juan Tessone, C., Mavrodiev, P., Perony, N., (2014) The digital traces of bubbles: feedback cycles between socio-economic signals in the Bitcoin economy, , http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1408.1494G; Garcia, D., Schweitzer, F., (2015) Social signals and algorithmic trading of bitcoin, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01513, CoRR abs/1506.01513; Grayson, M.R., Kwak, M., Choi, A., Using time-series and sentiment analysis to detect the determinants of bitcoin prices (2014) Issues in Information Systems, 15 (2), pp. 350-358; Hayes, A., Cryptocurrency value formation: an empirical analysis leading to a cost of production model for valuing bitcoin (2016) Telematics and Informatics, , www.researchgate.net/publication/303094852_Cryptocurrency_Value_Formation_An_empirical_study_leading_to_a_cost_of_production_model_for_valuing_Bitcoin; Jobson, J.D., Korkie, B.M., Performance hypothesis testing with the Sharpe and Treynor measures (1981) The Journal of Finance, 36 (4), pp. 889-908. , www.jstor.org/stable/2327554; Jurek, A., Mulvenna, M.D., Bi, Y., Improved lexicon-based sentiment analysis for social media analytics (2015) Security Informatics, 4 (1), pp. 1-13. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13388-015-0024-x; Kaminski, J., Gloor, P.A., (2014) Nowcasting the bitcoin market with twitter signals, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7577, CoRR abs/1406.7577; Kaushik, C., Mishra, A., (2014) A scalable, lexicon based technique for sentiment analysis, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2265, CoRR abs/1410.2265; Kristoufek, L., (2013) Bitcoin meets google trends and wikipedia: Quantifying the relationship between phenomena of the internet era, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep03415, Scientific Reports 3, 3415 EP; Loughran, T., McDonald, B., When is a liability not a liability?

Investors are continually seeking new ways to extract meaningful information about the future direction of price changes. Recently, cryptocurrencies have attracted huge attention due to their unique way of transferring value as well as its value as a hedge. A method proposed in this project involves using data mining techniques: mining text documents such as news articles and tweets try to infer the relationship between information contained in such items and cryptocurrency price direction. The Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) assists in creating a hybrid model which comprises of sentiment analysis techniques, as well as a predictive machine learning model. The success of the model was evaluated within the context of predicting the direction of Bitcoin price changes. Findings reported here reveal that our system yields more accurate and real-time predictions of Bitcoin price fluctuations when compared to other existing models in the market.

It has consequently become an investment vehicle in itself and is traded in a way similar to other open currencies. The ability to predict the price fluctuation of Bitcoin would therefore facilitate future investment and payment decisions. In order to predict the price fluctuation of Bitcoin, we analyse the comments posted in the Bitcoin online forum. Unlike most research on Bitcoin-related online forums, which is limited to simple sentiment analysis and does not pay sufficient attention to note-worthy user comments, our approach involved extracting keywords from Bitcoin-related user comments posted on the online forum with the aim of analytically predicting the price and extent of transaction fluctuation of the currency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on Bitcoin online forum data ranging over a period of 2.8 years from December 2013 to September 2016. © 2017 Kim et al.

In particular, it has been possible to witness the online emergence of web 2.0 services that have been widely used as communication media. On one hand, services such as blogs, tweets, forums, chats, email have gained wide popularity. On the other hand, due to the huge amount of available information, searching has become dominant in the use of Internet. Millions of users daily interact with search engines, producing valuable sources of interesting data regarding several aspects of the world. Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency, represents a radical change in financial systems, attracting a large number of users and a lot of media attention. In this work we studied whether Bitcoin’s trading volume is related to the web search and social volumes about Bitcoin. We investigated whether public sentiment, expressed in large-scale collections of daily Twitter posts, can be used to predict the Bitcoin market too. We achieved significant cross correlation outcomes, demonstrating the search and social volumes power to anticipate trading volumes of Bitcoin currency. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Bitcoin; Cross correlation analysis; Google trends; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter; Web search media",,"Kaplan, A.M., Haenlein, M., Users of the world, unite! the challenges and opportunities of social media (2010) Bus.

This is especially important for computational finance, where digital traces of human behaviour offer a great potential to drive trading strategies. We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment. © 2015 The Authors.","Algorithmic trading; Bitcoin; Computational social science; Polarization; Prediction; Sentiment","146499","Lazer, D., Life in the network: The coming age of computational social science (2009) Science, 323, pp. 721-723; Schweitzer, F., Vespignani, A., Editorial (2012) EPJ Data Sci, 1, p. 1; Treleaven, P., Galas, M., Lalchand, V., Algorithmic trading review (2013) Commun.

Sharing knowledge is an important part of learning and enhancing skills. Furthermore, emotions may affect decision-making and individual behavior. Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency system, represents a radical change in financial systems, attracting a large number of users and a lot of media attention. In this work, we investigated if the spread of the Bitcoin’s price is related to the volumes of tweets or Web Search media results. We compared trends of price with Google Trends data, volume of tweets and particularly with those that express a positive sentiment. We found significant cross correlation values, especially between Bitcoin price and Google Trends data, arguing our initial idea based on studies about trends in stock and goods market. © 2015 CEUR-WS.

The aim of our paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the payment and investment features of Bitcoin, and their implications for the conduct of e-commerce. Since network externality theory suggests that the value of a network and its take-up are interlinked, we investigate both adoption and price formation. We discover that its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin's popularity, the sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants who have adopted this technology, and we model the share of sales paid for with this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. Our analysis examines how country-, customer-, and company-specific characteristics interact with the proportion of sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company features, use of other payment methods, customers' knowledge about Bitcoin, and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are significant determinants. The results will be of interest to traders who seek to understand factors driving prices and will help to inform vendors as to the most favorable circumstances for adopting the currency for online transactions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; digital money; electronic money; emerging technologies; financial services; online payments; peer-To-peer network; technology adoption","1479-E (2013","Ali, R., Barrdear, J., Clews, R., Southgate, J., The economics of digital currencies (2014) Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 54 (3), pp. 276-286; Allen, F., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Klapper, L., Peria, M.S.M., The foundations of financial inclusion: Understanding ownership and use of formal accounts (2012) World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, 6290; Allen, H., Innovations in retail payments: E-payments (2003) Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 43 (4), pp. 428-438; Androulaki, E., Karame, G.O., Roeschlin, M., Scherer, T., Capkun, S., Evaluating user privacy in Bitcoin (2013) Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing, 7859, pp. 34-51; Angel, J.J., McCabe, D., The ethics of payments: Paper, plastic or Bitcoin?
